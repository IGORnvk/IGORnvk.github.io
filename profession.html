            <h2>Future profession</h2>
            <img src="/images/profession.jpg" alt="profession">
            <p>In this post I will tell about three companies that I would like to work in future. 
               These companies are quite popular in the field of their development with employees all around the world.</p>
            <h2><a href="https://krafton.com/en/" target="_blank">Krafton</a></h2>
            <img class="company" src="/images/krafton.jpg" alt="krafton logo">
            <p>This is a gamedev company with the head office located in Seoul, South Korea, that created a couple of famous games. However, the most popular their project is, without a doubt, PUBG:BATTLEGROUNDS - first game in battle-royal 
                setting that broke the Steam record of number of people playing one game at the same time (over 3 million players in 2018). 
                It is created in Unreal Engine, as the most projects from Krafton. 
                Actually, this is my favourite game, and as a developer I would like to work on it in future, make it better and better. Also, I really like South Korea's culture and people, so that is another reason for me to get a job there. 
                There are a bunch of roles in the company, so I will name only a couple of them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game designer</li>
                <li>Engine engineer (my favourite)</li>
                <li>Concept artist</li>
                <li>Project manager</li>
                <li>Back-end engineer</li>
                <li>Technical artist</li>
                <li>Animator</li>
                <li>and a lot more...</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h2><a href="https://www.bungie.net/" target="_blank">Bungie Inc</a></h2>
            <img class="company" src="/images/bungie.jpg" alt="bungie logo">
            <p>Bungie is another huge gamedev company that is located in USA. I believe almost everyone knows their best game - Destiny 2. 
               That is a MMORPG project that became quite popular because of its graphics, scenario, cooperative quests and pvp mode. 
               As you may already guessed, this is my favourite roleplay game. In fact, I love RPGs and have already created one (I mentioned it on the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page), 
               so, besides battle-royal, I would also like to move in that direction. What I like in that company, is that the workers are extremely motivated and love what they are doing, they always try to improve the project they are creating.
                Bungie creates games in Tiger engine, which is quite old for modern game development, but they managed to improve it. 
               As at Krafton, Bungie has a large number of experts working on the projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Character artist</li>
                <li>Visual designer</li>
                <li>Gameplay systems engineer (my favourite)</li>
                <li>UI engineer</li>
                <li>Gameplay designer</li>
                <li>and, again, a lot more...</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a href="https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us" target="_blank">SoftServe</a></h2>
            <img src="/images/softserve.jpg" alt="softserve logo">
            <p>That company is one of the biggest in Ukraine with the head office in Lviv and Austin (USA). 
                In fact, SoftServe specialices on software development and has more than 10000 employees. 
                The company offers a lot of possibilities to get an internship and the real experience of developing. 
                The thing that I really like is that they plan every step of software development: from brainstorming to post-delivery support of the product. 
                This type of planning gradualy reduce the amount of errors and problems that may appear during the work. Here are some of the positions that they offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React.js software engineer</li>
                <li>Business analyst</li>
                <li>Ruby engineer</li>
                <li>Cloud architect</li>
                <li>Full stack engineer (Java) (my favourite)</li>
                <li>Big data engineer</li>
                <li>and a lot more...</li>
            </ul>
